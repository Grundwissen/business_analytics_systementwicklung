# business_analytics_systementwicklung

This is simulated university audit evaluation gui with PostgreSQL as database. 
The goal of the project is by choosing a university class you will get a report with common statistic evaluation results 
and in addition you can print your report as pdf.
The data was syntetic generated and is stored in a database. 

The gui was written in Python and the communication between the gui and the database was written in R. It was a conscious decision to build it like that, to get knowledge in the interaction of Python, R and PostgreSQL.
